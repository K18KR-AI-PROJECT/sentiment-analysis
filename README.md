# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

This project is about finding the emotions behind any sentence/paragraph/file.

We have implemented it by using two methods - 

# Method 1
This is implemented without using nltk and is cmd based.
We put our text in the read.txt file and run the program and we can see the emotions in the text with their count and a graph in the result.

# Method 2
This is implemented using nltk and is GUI based.
We enter our text in the text box and click the "Go" button and we can see the emotions in the text with their count and a graph will be saved as image in the same directory as the code.

# Modules used
nltk
matplotlib
tkinter
